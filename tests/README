This folders contains a few tests to get you started.
The file minic-stdlib.h is only included so that you can compile these tests using your existing local compiler (e.g. GCC, MSVC).
Note that this header file should be completely ignored by your own compiler.

For instance, you can compile the fiboacci program on Linux by typing:

gcc fibonacci.c -o fibonacci
